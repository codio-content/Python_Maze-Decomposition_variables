See what happens when you make a deliberate mistake. For instance 

- `numEntities = *&^` or 
- `numEntities =`.

If you look at the code on the left, you can see we have made a deliberate mistake `numEntities = *&^`. Javascript does not understand this, so it throws a syntax error.

## Play around
Make some mistakes and press the reload button to see what happens. Then fix the mistakes again.

|||definition
The error you got if you run the code with something like `numEntities = *&^` is known as a *syntax error*.

Programming languages have something called *syntax*. This is a set of rules you need to follow for the program to be understood.

This is similar to spelling and grammar in a spoken language.
