|||definition
A variable is a named placeholder for a value and that value can change over time.
|||

Here are some examples of variable names and values being assigned to them.

- width = 40
- height = 30
- numberOfMonsters = 4
- X = 5
- Y = 12

These values can be changed at any time. 

Other parts of your program can inspect what value a variable contains and then use that value to do something.

## Maze width and height example
If we use a variable `width = 16` and `height = 15` then we **call** `createEmptyMaze()`, the game could be set to look at `width` and `height` and set the size based on those variable values.

## 'Calling' a function
When you use an instruction like `createEmptyMaze(14, 8)` the terminology we use is 'we *call* the function named `createEmptyMaze`'.
