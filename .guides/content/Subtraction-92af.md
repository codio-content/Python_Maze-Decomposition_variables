Now we'll do the same sort of thing but this time we'll use subtraction rather than addition.


## Explanation
1. This code is setting a variable called `numMonsters` to 6.
1. It then creates a new variable called `numEnergies` and assigns it whatever value is contained by `numMonsters` and subtracts 2 from it.
1. It then creates another variable called `numWalls` and adds whatever was contained in `numEnergies` and subtracts 1 from that.

## Experiment
Feel free to play around some more in any way you like.
