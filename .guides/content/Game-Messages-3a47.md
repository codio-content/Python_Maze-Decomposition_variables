Our game has a nice way of writing text onto the bottom wall of our game.

Take a look at the code on the left. Here we are using a function called `showMessage()` that displays a message.

This code displays a simple message below the game.


## Assigning a string variable
Don't forget, when you assign a string to a variable, you have to enclose the string in `'   '`. 

- `string = 'Hello World'` is valid.
- `string = Hello World` is wrong and will generate an error.

## Play
Play around with the string in the code on the left. You will probably get a few syntax errors, which is fine. Just correct them and you will learn what works and what doesn't.
