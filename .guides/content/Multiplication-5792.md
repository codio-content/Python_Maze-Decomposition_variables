And here we go yet again, but this time we are going to use multiplication.

In the last example, we saw that `numMonsters + 1` adds 1 to whatever is contained within `numMonsters`. 

To use multiplication, we use `numMonsters * 2` to multiply `numMonsters` by 2.

## Explanation
1. This code is setting a variable called `numMonsters` to 2.
1. It then creates a new variable called `numEnergies` and assigns it whatever value is contained by `numMonsters` multiplied by 2.
1. It then creates another variable called `numWalls` and adds whatever was contained in `numMonsters` and multiplies it by 2 again.

## Experiment
Feel free to play around some more in any way you like.
