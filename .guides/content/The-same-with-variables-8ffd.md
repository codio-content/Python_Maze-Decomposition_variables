If you look at the code on the left, you can see we have taken a different approach to doing the same thing.

1. We use 2 variables and assign them both values.
1. We then create our empty maze and rather than pass in the values directly, we pass in the `width` and `height` variables, which contain the values previously assigned. 

## Experiment
- Try changing the width and height variable values
- Try renaming `width` to another name then change the variable name in the brackets to this new name. See what happens if the variable names don't match.
