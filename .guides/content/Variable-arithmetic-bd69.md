Let's look at something called variable arithmetic. Take a look at the code on the left. Can you see what it is doing?

## Explanation
1. This code is setting a variable called `numMonsters` to 2.
1. It then creates a new variable called `numEnergy` and assigns it whatever value is contained by `numMonsters` and adds 2 to it.
1. It then creates another variable called `numWalls` and adds whatever was contained in `numEnergy` and adds 3 to that.

## Experiment
So you get a good feel for this, play around with it.

1. Try varying the numbers you add to the variables.
1. In the function calls, you can replace a variable name with an actual value if you like.

Try out whatever you like and see what happens. You can learn a lot by playing around with things.
