This next example shows how variables can be really useful. 

We want to create 3 monsters, 3 walls and 3 energy stores. 

- Notice how we have now only had to define a single variable called `numEntities`.
- Look at the functions. We have used the same variable in each case because we want the same value to be used. 

## Play
Try changing the value from 3 to something higher (but not too high or the game will not add any at all).
