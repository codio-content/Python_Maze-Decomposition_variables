## Fix and format challenge
|||challenge
If you look at the code on the left, we have two issues to sort out.

1. The code has a syntax error, so find it and fix it. Read the error message that pops up. It gives you some clues.
1. Once you have fixed it, you will see that we need spaces between between the words 'Maryhadalittlelamb'. Modify the code to get the right result.

When it looks right, press the button below.
