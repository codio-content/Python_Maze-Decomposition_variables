Create a variable called `numMonsters` to store the number of monsters.  Assign the value of 2\n1. Create the monsters using this variable as the argument.\n1. Create another variable called `numOthers` and assign it a value  of 3 for the number of energies and walls you want to create.\n1. Now create the energies and walls using this one variable.\n1.
